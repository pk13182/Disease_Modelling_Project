# Disease_Modelling_Project


This repository contains my project report on **Modelling of Fatty Liver**, guided by **Dr. Ganesh Madabattula and Dr. Gowri Balachander, IIT (BHU), Varanasi** (Feb 2025â€“Present).

## Overview
- Studied a **reactionâ€“diffusion model** of epithelial wound healing driven by **EGF**.  
- Solved and simulated the **non-linear PDE system** for **EGF concentration** and **cell density** using **COMSOL Multiphysics** to analyze **wound closure dynamics**.  

  Now, we have transitioned towards solving the real problem of the project , that is modelling of fatty liver.
  Some literature review is done , but experimental things are still in progress.

## Future Scope
This work was aimed not only at studying corneal wound healing but also at demonstrating how mathematical models can capture biological healing and regeneration processes. Building on this foundation, the next phase of the research focuses on modeling human fatty liver regeneration, with particular emphasis on hepatocyte state transitions, growth factor regulation, and tissue recovery dynamics.
