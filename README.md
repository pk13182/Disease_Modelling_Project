# Disease_Modelling_Project


This repository contains my project report on **Modelling of Fatty Liver**, guided by **Dr. Ganesh Madabattula and Dr. Gowri Balachander, IIT (BHU), Varanasi** (Feb 2025â€“Present).

## Overview
- Studied a **reactionâ€“diffusion model** of epithelial wound healing driven by **EGF**.  
- Solved and simulated the **non-linear PDE system** for **EGF concentration** and **cell density** using **COMSOL Multiphysics** to analyze **wound closure dynamics**.  

  Now, we have transitioned towards solving the real problem of the project , that is modelling of fatty liver.
  Some literature review is done , but experimental things are still in progress.
